SKOS <---> Excel
================

A tool to assist Arches translators.

Previous work: https://github.com/ads04r/po2excel

This script is currently in development. Its purpose is to take an
Arches thesaurus in SKOS(RDF/XML) format and spit out an Excel
file, optionally translating into an additional language, much
like po2excel did.

The reverse script (not written yet) will take the checked
spreadsheet and recreate the thesaurus for importing back into
Arches.
